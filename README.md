I've asked [OpenAI's ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) to solve [Cryptopals challenges](https://cryptopals.com) in Node.js, then convert the solutions to Rust and Go. All versions have been tested and fixed if necessary.

### Node

From repo root run `node node/sol_01` etc.

### Rust

From repo root run `cargo run --manifest-path=rust/Cargo.toml --example sol_01` etc.

### Go

From repo root run `go run go/sol_01.go` etc.
