The [CryptoPals challenges](https://cryptopals.com) are a great way to learn and practice various concepts related to cryptography. These challenges are designed to be progressively more difficult, which allows learners to build up their understanding and skills as they work through the challenges.

The challenges cover a wide range of topics, including symmetric and asymmetric encryption, block ciphers, stream ciphers, hash functions, and more. They also provide a good balance between theory and practice, as the challenges often require learners to implement the concepts they've learned in code.

Additionally, the challenges are designed to be open-ended, which allows learners to explore different solutions and approaches. This can help to foster creativity and critical thinking, as well as to expose learners to different ways of solving problems.

Overall, I think that the CryptoPals challenges are a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning about cryptography, and I would recommend them to anyone looking to improve their understanding and skills in this area.

Yep, ChatGPT wrote this too. While it knocked some tasks out of the park in its first answer, others required more of a discussion, fixing and piecing multiple answers together. The code in this repo is the final result of these interactions.
