### Cryptopals challenge:

One of the 60-character strings in [this file](https://cryptopals.com/static/challenge-data/4.txt) has been encrypted by single-character XOR. Find it. Your code from previous challenge should help.

### Original ChatGPT answer:

Yes, you can use the decryptXOR function I provided to attempt to decrypt each of the strings in the file you provided. Here's an example of how you can read the file and use the function to decrypt each line:

```
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('4.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
        throw err;
    }

    // Split the file contents by newline
    const lines = data.split('\n');

    // Iterate through each line
    for (let i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
        // Attempt to decrypt the line
        console.log("Line: " + (i+1));
        decryptXOR(lines[i]);
        console.log("\n");
    }
});
```

This will iterate through each line in the file, and attempt to decrypt it using the decryptXOR function. And you will get the best key and best decryption for each line. But you need to check for which one the best key and decryption make sense and it's a valid english message.
